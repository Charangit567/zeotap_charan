Data Science Assignment: eCommerce 
Transactions Dataset 
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce dataset to derive valuable business insights, build predictive models, and segment customers based on their transactional and profile data. The dataset consists of three key files: Customers, Products, and Transactions. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Modeling, and Customer Segmentation, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can be used for personalized marketing and business strategy development.

Files
This repository contains the following files:

Customers.csv: Contains data on each customer, including their unique identifier, region, and signup date.
Products.csv: Contains details of products, including their name, category, and price.
Transactions.csv: Contains transactional data, including customer ID, product ID, transaction date, and purchase details.
Project Tasks
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Clean and analyze the data using various statistical and visualization techniques.
Derive business insights that help identify key customer behaviors, product trends, and other valuable metrics.
Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook with EDA code and visualizations.
PDF report with at least 5 business insights derived from the data.
2. Lookalike Model
Build a recommendation system that finds the top 3 most similar customers for a given customer based on their profile and transaction history.
Use customer and product information to calculate similarity scores.
Deliverables:
CSV file with the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
Jupyter Notebook explaining the model, including code and methodology.
3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to group customers based on transactional and profile data.
Use relevant clustering metrics (such as DB Index) to evaluate the quality of clusters.
Deliverables:
PDF report on clustering results, including cluster count and evaluation metrics.
Jupyter Notebook with clustering code and visualizations.
